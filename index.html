                <h3>Introduction / Background</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past couple of weeks, wildfires have been running rampant in the west coast , causing tremendous amounts of damage to forestland, wildlife, and property. Although wildfires burn every year, the ones this year have been more destructive than those in the past, even causing states to declare states of emergency and evacuate people from their homes. So far in 2020, there were around 44.5 thousand wildfires in the US which burned around 7.5 million acres of land. There is a great need for wildfire prediction, wildfire detection, and spread prediction.

                <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the rampant destructive nature of fires most prevalent within areas throughout the West Coast and MidWest we seek to ameliorate the potential occurrence of wildfires through the usage of machine learning and advanced data visualization techniques. This would involve predicting areas of high risk areas prone to unmitigatable fires, constantly adding in new data in order to create predictive and proactive options for fire detection, and finally creating an environment where spread prediction can also be observed and create data-driven actionable steps to defend populations from the harmful effects of fires.

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of variables in our dataset, allowing us to determine which features accurately represent our data. We will test a few different methods with both the PCA-reduced and raw dataset. To predict the spread of a fire based on other variables, like duration, location, and cause of the wildfire, we will use supervised learning methods like linear regression, neural nets, decision trees, and/or SVM. We will randomly select training and testing data for each year in our dataset. We may also perform time series forecasting to predict differences in wildfires over the years.

            <div id = "results">
                <h3>Potential Results</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to be able to predict areas at high-risk to fires as a result of our methods, as well as generate a predictable spread of any given fire. These can be visually mapped on a heat map with a time slider that would serve as a good way to visualize our results. In addition, we could also factor in elements such as potential property damage and city preparedness to the model. We expect the PCA to do well to identify key factors contributing to the spread of wildfires, and that a CNN will do a good job with predicting a path of spread. However, other supervised learning methods may also perform well.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to predict the location and intensity of wildfires and detect where they are quickly and how they will spread would allow people to contain them and greatly minimize potential damages and costs. It would also allow people to take appropriate steps to evacuate and avoid dangerous areas before the wildfires grow in intensity. We imagine that some potential difficulties we will face is that the data that the model ingests may not be complete or accurate enough to correctly predict wildfires at the granularity that we desire or consider effective.
