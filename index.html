                <h3>Introduction / Background</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past couple of weeks, wildfires have been running rampant in the west coast , causing tremendous amounts of damage to forestland, wildlife, and property. Although wildfires burn every year, the ones this year have been more destructive than those in the past, even causing states to declare states of emergency and evacuate people from their homes. So far in 2020, there were around 44.5 thousand wildfires in the US which burned around 7.5 million acres of land (Facts Statistics: Wildfires 2020). There is a great need for wildfire prediction, wildfire detection, and spread prediction.

                <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the destructive nature of fires by humans (e.g. Prestemon et al. 2002; Mercer and Prestemon 2005; Prestemon and Butry 2005; Mercer et al. 2007; Prestemon et al. 2013) most prevalent within areas throughout the West Coast and MidWest we seek to ameliorate the potential occurrence of wildfires through the usage of machine learning and advanced data visualization techniques. This would involve predicting areas of high risk areas prone to unmitigatable fires, constantly adding in new data in order to create predictive and proactive options for fire detection, and finally creating an environment where spread prediction can also be observed and create data-driven actionable steps to defend populations.

            <div id = "methods">
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of variables in our <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires">kaggle wildfires dataset</a>, allowing us to determine which features accurately represent our data. We will test a few different methods with both the PCA-reduced and raw dataset. To predict the spread of a fire based on other variables, like duration, location, and cause of the wildfire, we will use supervised learning methods like linear regression, neural nets, decision trees, and/or SVM. We will randomly select training and testing data for each year in our dataset. We may also perform time series forecasting to predict differences in wildfires over the years.

            <div id = "results">
                <h3>Potential Results</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to be able to predict areas at high-risk to fires as a result of our methods, as well as generate a predictable spread of any given fire. These can be visually mapped on a heat map with a time slider that would serve as a good way to visualize our results. In addition, we could also factor in elements such as potential property damage and city preparedness to the model. We expect the PCA to do well to identify key factors contributing to the spread of wildfires, and that a CNN will do a good job with predicting a path of spread. However, other supervised learning methods may also perform well.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to predict the location and intensity of wildfires and detect where they are quickly and how they will spread would allow people to contain them and greatly minimize potential damages and costs. It would also allow people to take appropriate steps to evacuate and avoid dangerous areas before the wildfires grow in intensity. We imagine that some potential difficulties we will face is that the data that the model ingests may not be complete or accurate enough to dynamically predict wildfires at the granularity that we desire or consider effective due to feeding live data into existing models (e.g. Salehi et al. 2016.)

                <h4>Neural Network</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this test, we essentially used the fire size and fire duration tables to predict the cause of the fire. To start, we calculate duration by finding the difference between the contained date and the discovery date. Next, we set X to a concatenated matrix of fire size and duration, while setting y to the labels of the cause of the fire. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, we set the y labels to numbers using preprocessing algorithms from sklearning. At this point, the data is ready to be split into testing and training datasets. We plug scale our X datasets and plug them into the neural network algorithms from sklearning. Here are the results:</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the accuracy of the prediction left a little to be desired, however, the results can be positively altered by experimenting with the amount of nodes and layers. Furthermore, we can also look to predict other columns of the dataset. </p>
