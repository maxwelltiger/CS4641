                <h3>Introduction / Background</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past couple of weeks, wildfires have been running rampant in the west coast (Oregon, Washington, California, etc.), causing tremendous amounts of damage to forestland, wildlife, and property. Although these wildfires occur every year, the wildfires that have been burning recently have been of greater magnitude and intensity than those of previous years, burning up millions more acres of land and even causing states to declare states of emergency and evacuate people from their homes. From January 1st to September 30, 2020, there were around 44.5 thousand wildfires in the US, burning 7.5 million acres of land; the number and severity of these wildfires is far greater compared to 2019, with around 39.5 thousand wildfires burning 4.4 million acres of land in the same time period. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these wildfires keep burning and cause millions of dollars of damages every year, there is a great need for wildfire prediction, wildfire detection, and spread prediction. If we are able to predict the location and intensity of wildfire before they grow, we would be able to contain these wildfires and greatly minimize damages and costs. Similarly, by detecting these wildfires early on in their lifecycle, people would be able to take appropriate steps to prevent destruction and spread. Finally, if we are not able to predict and detect these wildfires beforehand, predicting the spread of these wildfires will allow people to alert those in affected and dangerous areas. There is great opportunity in training and implementing models in these areas.

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of variables in our dataset, allowing us to determine which features accurately represent our data. We will test a few different methods with both the PCA-reduced and raw dataset. To predict the spread of a fire based on other variables, like duration, location, and cause of the wildfire, we will use supervised learning methods like linear regression, neural nets, decision trees, and/or SVM. We will randomly select training and testing data for each year in our dataset. We may also perform time series forecasting to predict differences in wildfires over the years.
